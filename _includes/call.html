                  <p>Submissions should be in the form of extended abstracts of no more than 1 page (not including references or supplementary materials).

                      All submissions must use the AKBC template. Submissions should be in .pdf format, and the review process is double-blindâ€”therefore the papers should be appropriately anonymised. Previously published work (or under-review) is acceptable.

                     Accepted work will be presented as posters during the workshop and listed on this website.
